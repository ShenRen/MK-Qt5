This simulation contains 2 different types of latency test.

axis_mm_latency_test_single.ini
    This test lauches Axis and runs a servo thread only
    latency test in parallel


axis_mm_latency_test_double.ini
    This test lauches Axis and runs both base and servo thread
    latency test in parallel

You may find that the double test produces considerably lower
latency jitter on newer multi-core processors.

This is due to the fact that it helps keep the larger caches
on these processors full and keep the rt code in one cache.

If so consider running a dummy 25 - 50K base-thread in your configuration.
